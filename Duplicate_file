VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM (VCS)
It is a software utility that tracks and manages changes to a filesystem
A repository is a vcs term which describes when vcsis tracking a filesystem
Vcs tracks addition, deletion, modifications of the text applied to files and directories
Need of VCS
1.Conflict resolution
A VCS will tracks and aids in conflicts between multiple developers. These conflict resolution operations 
leave an audit trail that provides insight into the history of a project.
2.Rollback and undo changes to source code
If a bug is discovered in a live application, the code can be quickly reverted to a known stable version
3.Offsite source code backup
When using a VCS collaboratively, a remote instance of the VCS needs to be created to share changes between 
developers. This remote VCS instance could be hosted off-site with a trusted third-party like Bitbucket. It then 
becomes a secure offsite backup. 
Benefits of VCS
1.Team communication 
2.Extended third party integrations
3.Insight, measurement and accountability 
Types of Architecture
1.Centralised 
It has remote central vcs instance. If this instance is lost, it can cause productivity and data loss and it will 
need to be replaced with another copy of the source code. If it becomes temporarily becomes unavailable, it will 
prevent developers from pushing, merging or rolling back code
2.Distributed 
Keeps a copy of source code at each vcs instance. If any failure happens, a new vcs instance can be swapped in to 
lead development mitigating any serious drop in productivity
