VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM (VCS)
It is a software utility that tracks and manages changes to a file system
A repository is a vcs term which describes when vcs is tracking a file system
Vcs tracks addition, deletion, modifications of the text applied to files and directories
Need of VCS
Conflict resolution
A VCS will tracks and aids in conflicts between multiple developers. These conflict resolution operations leave an audit trail that provides insight into the history of a project.
2.	Rollback and undo changes to source code
If a bug is discovered in a live application, the code can be quickly reverted to a known stable version
3.	Offsite source code backup
When using a VCS collaboratively, a remote instance of the VCS needs to be created to share changes between developers. This remote VCS instance could be hosted off-site with a trusted third-party like Bitbucket. It then becomes a secure offsite backup. 
Benefits of VCS
Team communication 
Extended third party integrations
Insight, measurement and accountability 
Types of Architecture
Centralised 
It has remote central vcs instance. If this instance is lost, it can cause productivity and data loss and it will need to be replaced with another copy of the source code. If it becomes temporarily becomes unavailable, it will prevent developers from pushing, merging or rolling back code
2.	Distributed 
Keeps a copy of source code at each vcs instance. If any failure happens, a new vcs instance can be swapped in to lead development mitigating any serious drop in productivity
